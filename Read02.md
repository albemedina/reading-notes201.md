# Class-02 Reading Basics of HTML, CSS & JS
1. HTML is the structure and content of webpages, wrote extensively about that in yesterday's assignment. Think of this as the skeletal system of a webpage. There are multiple tags in HTML that you can use such as:

headers that are <h1></h1> through <h6></h6>
paragraphs that are <p></p>
body where you put all your content into <body></body>
the HMTL tag itself <html></html>
your bold and italics like <b></b> <i></i>.

As you can see there are multiple tags to make your HTML webpage as amazing as possible.

2. CSS: CSS means Cascading Style sheets- It's like the artwork that draws and brings your HTML Blank webage to more life
reads top to bottom so that however you're styling your webpage it'll follow in the order as such.

Specificity by selector  - types, classes, id, universal !important 

```
<p>, {curly bracket} 
Types: h1, h2, span, div, header
  example: h1 {this means for all h1 types}
class - 
rule set  
h1 {color: blue; // declaration property/value
    background-color: pink;}
  <h1 id="firsth1">color me blue</>
  
  group things like this: p, img, header {make rule set} that applies to all 
```

Css is thinking 'inside the box'. 
* It modifies the information (color, font, size) inside of the HTML. 
External vs Internal-better to separate (external) if webpage is larger than one page. 

*color: RGB= Red/Green/Blue.
Hex codes represent values for red, green, blue in hexadecimal code. 
147 color names
Hue: 
Saturation is how much gray . 
Brightness: How much black is in color
Contrast: Text is easeir to read in high contrast, but can get tiring if long passages. 
Opacity opacity rgba: is set between 0.0-1.0
CSS3; HSL Colors: Hue, Saturation, Lightnes

* So--it seems there are a few different 'dials' to make color. 
Color name, hex Codes, RGB values. Then there are finer aspects of the color itself. 
another way to think of it is big rocks and smaller definitions of those rocks.

  Linking: 
  <head>
   >link rel="stylesheet" href="myCssFile.css">
   command ? makes everything comment the line. 
   header
   <nav

3. Javascript: This is the functionality of wepbages. It's what makes the page more interactive and fun to play with. Of course this all depends on what group audience your website is geared towards as well

* Pesronally reading and working with javascript I have found this to be more difficult to create and work with than HTML & CSS
You have while loops, for loops, strings, variables. I could go on and on on what makes all of these interactive for your webpage.
